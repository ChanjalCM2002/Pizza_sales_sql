🍕 SQL Pizza Sales Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using SQL to uncover meaningful business insights related to orders, revenue, customer demand, and product performance. The goal is to demonstrate strong SQL fundamentals and the ability to translate raw transactional data into actionable insights.

The analysis answers real-world business questions such as:

How many orders were placed?

How much revenue was generated?

Which pizzas and categories perform the best?

What are the peak ordering hours?

All analysis, queries, and outputs are documented in a structured PDF.

🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of multiple relational tables:

orders – order-level details (date, time)

order_details – quantity of each pizza per order

pizzas – pizza size and price

pizza_types – pizza name and category

These tables are connected using primary and foreign keys to enable relational analysis.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
